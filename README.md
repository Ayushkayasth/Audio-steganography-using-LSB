# Audio Steganography with LSB Embedding in Python

This project implements a technique called **audio steganography** to hide secret messages within audio files. It uses the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** method, where the message bits are embedded subtly into the least significant bits of the audio data. 

**Features:**

* Embed secret messages into WAV audio files.
* Extract hidden messages from steganographed audio files (requires original audio for key).
* Developed in Python using the `wave` library. 

**Target Audience:**

* This project is ideal for those interested in learning about audio steganography concepts and the LSB embedding technique.
* It can also serve as a foundation for further development and exploration of more advanced steganographic methods.

**Note:**

* Steganography techniques might not be suitable for highly sensitive information as advanced analysis tools could potentially reveal the hidden message.
